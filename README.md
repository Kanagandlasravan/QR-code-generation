# QR-code-generation
A Quick Response Code or a QR Code is a two-dimensional bar code used for its fast readability and comparatively large storage capacity. It consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background. Python has a library “qrcode” for generating QR code images. so I created a  QR code in python using module image and qr ode.
